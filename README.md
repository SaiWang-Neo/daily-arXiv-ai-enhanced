# How to use
This repo will daily crawl arXiv papers about **cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.CL and cs.AI**, and use **DeepSeek** to summarize the papers in **Chinese**.
If you wish to crawl other arXiv categories, use other LLMs, or other languages, please follow the instructions.
Otherwise, you can directly use this repo in https://dw-dengwei.github.io/daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced/. Please star it if you like :)

**Instructions:**
1. Fork this repo to your own account and delete my own information in [buy-me-a-coffee](./buy-me-a-coffee/README.md).
2. Go to: your-own-repo -> Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions
3. Go to Secrets. Secrets are encrypted and used for sensitive data
4. Create two repository secrets named `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, and input corresponding values.
5. [Optional] Set a password in `secrets.ACCESS_PASSWORD` if you do not wish others to access your page. (see https://github.com/dw-dengwei/daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced/pull/64)
6. Go to Variables. Variables are shown as plain text and are used for non-sensitive data
7. Create the following repository variables:
   1. `CATEGORIES`: separate the categories with ",", such as "cs.CL, cs.CV"
   2. `LANGUAGE`: such as "Chinese" or "English"
   3. `MODEL_NAME`: such as "deepseek-chat"
   4. `EMAIL`: your email for push to GitHub
   5. `NAME`: your name for push to GitHub
8. Go to your-own-repo -> Actions -> arXiv-daily-ai-enhanced
9. You can manually click **Run workflow** to test if it works well (it may take about one hour). By default, this action will automatically run every day. You can modify it in `.github/workflows/run.yml`
10. Set up GitHub pages: Go to your own repo -> Settings -> Pages. In `Build and deployment`, set `Source="Deploy from a branch"`, `Branch="main", "/(root)"`. Wait for a few minutes, go to https://\<username\>.github.io/daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced/. Please see this [issue](https://github.com/dw-dengwei/daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced/issues/14) for more precise instructions.
